PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application created as part of my Internshala Full Stack Web Development Internship Training. With guidance from the training, I developed this web application based on my understanding and customized it to enhance user experience with improved functionalities.
The web app is hosted at: https://lasya.free.nf/index.php
It is fully responsive and operational on any device.
